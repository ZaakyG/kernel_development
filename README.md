This is a git repository with the purpose 
of having different c files across multiple linux distributions
without the need to actually type every time the same files
over and over. 

Some things to consider are:
	- Since the files are designed for kernel, some features may 
		not work depending on the distribution
	- The make files must not be uploaded to the git repository 
		as these would cause problem due to the different distributions and versions
